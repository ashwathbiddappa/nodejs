1. Introduction
This document provides an overview of the project setup, including the Dockerfile, CI/CD pipelines, and deployment procedure.

2. Dockerfile
The Dockerfile defines the environment and setup for running the Node.js application within a Docker container. Here's a breakdown of the Dockerfile:

Base Image: Uses the official Node.js runtime as the base image.
Maintainer: Specifies the maintainer of the Dockerfile.
Working Directory: Sets the working directory within the container to /app/nodejs.
Copy Application Code: Copies the application source code into the working directory.
Expose Port: Exposes port 8080 for the web server.
Run Command: Specifies the command to run the Node.js application.


3. CI Pipeline (Jenkins)
The CI pipeline automates the build, test, and deployment process of the Node.js application. Here's how the CI pipeline works:

Checkout: Clones the source code from the repository.
Build Docker Image: Builds the Docker image for the Node.js application.
Run Tests: Executes any tests associated with the application (currently a dummy test).
Push to ECR: Tags and pushes the Docker image to an ECR (Elastic Container Registry) repository.


4. CD Pipeline (Jenkins)
The CD pipeline automates the deployment of the infrastructure and the application to AWS ECS. Here's how the CD pipeline works:

Checkout: Clones the Terraform scripts from the repository.
Deploy Infrastructure with Terraform: Initializes Terraform, plans the infrastructure changes, and applies them to create the ECS cluster and associated resources.
Notify Stakeholders: Sends notification emails to stakeholders about the successful deployment.

5. Terraform Deployment
The Terraform script deploys the ECS cluster, task definition, and service for the Node.js application. Here's a breakdown of the Terraform script:

6.USAGE OF WEBHOOKS :

i'll use webhooks to automate the build process whenever changes are made build will get triggered
